# Destructuring Structs

You can also destructure `structs`:

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../third_party/rust-by-example/destructuring-structs.rs}}
```
<details>

* Change the literal values in `foo` to match with the other patterns.
* Try adding a new field to the `Foo` struct and make changes to the pattern as needed
