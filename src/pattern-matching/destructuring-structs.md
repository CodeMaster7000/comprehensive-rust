{{#include ../../third_party/rust-by-example/destructuring-structs.rs}}
```

Key Points:
* Showcase the different ways you can match on a struct by giving the fields literal values, variables, and wildcards.
    * Illustrate how limitating a literal value can be, if itâ€™s unnecessary.
    * Point out that you can use a variable instead of a field then use that variable in the following code block.
