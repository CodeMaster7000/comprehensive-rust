# Destructuring Arrays

You can destructure arrays, tuples, and slices by matching on their elements:

```rust,editable
{{#include ../../third_party/rust-by-example/destructuring-arrays.rs}}
```

Key points:
* Continuing our journey in pattern matching, this slide just shows another type that can destructured with pattern matching. 
* This is a another great time to do some live coding. You can add/remove values from the array, compare the syntax `..` and `_`, and share any errors you get.
